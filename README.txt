To run the notebook on your environment, you need to install all packages from requirements.txt file.

The main.ipynb file is the main and only notebook of the project. There is a markdown header division beetwen next sections of the project.

The data was collected by web scraping mediaexpert.pl website.
The goal of this project was to analyse all the fridges on the website and create a model to guess the price of the fridge model based on given parameters.

Not all of the visualisations are in the visualisation section as they are often shown in other sections and I didn't want to replicate them.
